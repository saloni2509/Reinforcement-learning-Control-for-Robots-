# Reinforcement-learning-Control-for-Robots-

Using Linear Inverted Pendulum Model to derive Model Predictive Control law for stabilizing walking of legged robot and Implemented Model-free RL such as Q-learning for balancing Cartpole 

Implemented A^* to find the shortest path faster for robots in various mazes & policy gradient for IPM which are the mentioned under the "Optimal...Materials Respository"

This report tells us about the use of OpenAI Gym for balancing Cartpole, and how to generate the code that justify it.
